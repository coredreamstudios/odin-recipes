    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off bell peppers and remove the seeds. Cook bell peppers in 
           boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each bell pepper and set aside.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until
           beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and season with salt and pepper. 
           Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, rice, and Worcestershire sauce; reduce heat to low, cover, 
           and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Stuff each bell pepper with beef and rice mixture; arrange open-side up in a baking dish.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Combine tomato soup with just enough water in a medium bowl to make the soup a gravy consistency; pour over the bell peppers and cover with aluminum foil.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
    </ol>
